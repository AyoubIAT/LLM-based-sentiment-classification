# Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models

This project explores sentiment analysis using deep learning techniques, comparing traditional machine learning methods with deep learning models. It also evaluates different text representation techniques, such as traditional vectorization and word embeddings.

## Features
- Comparison of traditional vectorization methods (e.g., TF-IDF) vs. word embeddings
- Evaluation of machine learning models vs. deep learning models for sentiment analysis
- Implementation using PyTorch
- Analysis of the model's performance and limitations
